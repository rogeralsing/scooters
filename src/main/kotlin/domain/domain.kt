// Domain model
//
// The task contains no requirements on performance nor memory footprint, the requirements also states low numbers for size and ranges.
// Thus, choosing a solution with low development, maintenance and cognitive cost is favorable
//
// This solution runs in O(n) time
// (As opposed to the naive approach to brute force using O(nÂ²) time)
